This project conatains two classes: Point and Cluster
Point represents a point in n dimensional space 

  Member Variables:
    dim = dimension of the point
    values = 1Xdim array to hold values of each dimension


Cluster represents a collection of points. It uses a dynamically allocated singly linked list to hold the points.
  
  Member Variables:
    size = number of points in linked list
    points = pointer to the first node of the singly linked list
    
  
This was origionally compiled in Visual Studio Proffessional 2015 and checked to run in CLION with GCC
